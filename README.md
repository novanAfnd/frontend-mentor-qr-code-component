## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS BEM convention
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Besides learning HTML and CSS. I learned the BEM convention which makes it easier for me to name classes in HTML and use them in CSS.

Below is an example of code that uses the BEM convention

```html
<img class="card__image" src="/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="" />
<h1 class="card__heading">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
```

```css
.card__image {
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 18px;
  padding: 5px;
}
.card__heading {
  color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
  font-size: 22px;
  font-weight: 700;
  text-align: center;
  line-height: 26px;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future I will focus on learning HTML, CSS and JS. Maybe I'll also learn a library or framework.

And also, I will continue to learn to use the BEM convention. This technique is good but some web development tutorial providers do not discuss this.

### Useful resources

- [BEM in 6 minutes - CSS Methodology 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaXmoVZ3koo) - This helped me to learn about the BEM convention. This BEM convention helps me to simplify naming classes in HTML so that using CSS is easier and neater.
